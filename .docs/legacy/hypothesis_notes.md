# Nexus Theory

## Abstract

I'm assuming Bob Lazar is right and believe if that is true, then all craft follow same prinicples.
I'm treating this as a nettle in the haystack. It's a hobby and amateur research is the goal of my theory. Nothing more.
If I'm going to make a scientific modeling platform, then I'm going to make it into a tool.


## Hypothesis

The silver orb and similar craft operate using controlled gravitational field manipulation, 
achieved by generating localized spacetime distortion 
aka high-energy field geometries—likely electromagnetic or quantum in nature—thus enabling lift, 
inertia suppression, and silent propulsion without traditional thrust.
