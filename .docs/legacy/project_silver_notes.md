# 🧠 Project Silver – Development Notes
> Last updated: 2025-07-18

This file tracks active thoughts, design intentions, and architectural notes for Project Silver, 
a physics simulation system exploring classical and modern mechanics in multi-dimensional space 
using functional Python APIs under the Nexus Labs framework.

---

## 🔭 Project Summary

Project Silver is a computational physics platform designed to:
- Model physical bodies (e.g., metallic orbs) across 1–5D
- Simulate classical mechanics (position, velocity, acceleration, force, energy)
- Extend to electromagnetic, thermal, and relativistic dynamics
- Explore the effects of imaginary time (`t = iτ`) in force and energy systems

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

**Core Layers:**
- `main.py` — entry point for quick dev/testing
- `cli/project_silver.py` — official CLI interface to run control simulations
- `models/` — structured representations like `Orb`, `Vehicle`
- `equations/` — functional physics APIs (mechanics, EM, thermodynamics, etc.)
- `utils/` — unit conversion, constants, helper math
- `simulations/` — orchestration logic (e.g. time-stepping, world states)
- `configs/` — input setups for vehicles and simulations
- `enums/` — type-safe enums for materials, vehicle types, simulation modes
- `exceptions/` — all error types for safe failure handling

## 🧪 Simulation Focus Areas (Current)

1. ✅ 1–4D motion under classical Newtonian mechanics
2. ✅ Force modeling: F = ma, F = mg, torque
3. ✅ Energy systems: KE, PE, work, power, thermal
4. ✅ Coordinate systems: Rectangular, Polar, Spherical, Hyperspherical
5. ✅ Vehicle: `orb_speeder` with support for dynamic states
6. ⏳ Simulation orchestration via `Simulation.add_vehicle()` and `.run()`

## 🌌 Planned Extensions

- Maxwell’s Equations (E, B fields)
- Lorentz Force: `F = q(E + v × B)`
- Spring dynamics (Hookean + damped oscillators)
- Heat modeling (Q = mcΔT)
- Imaginary Time (`t = i * τ`) and its effect on inertia and acceleration
- Time-step engine with 1D–5D tracking
- Metrics export and CLI log/report output

---

## 🧩 Key Principles

- Functional API style: stateless physics functions
- Modularity: every concept in its own file/folder
- Pythonic: Pydantic models, clean typing, testable design
- SI Unit system, with automatic conversion from g/cm³ ↔ kg/m³ and cm³ ↔ m³
- CLI-first: all simulations executable via `project_silver.py`
- Physics-first: math must drive implementation; every output should map to real theory

## 🔗 Key Files

- `equation_notes.md` → Theory definitions and formulas
- `hypothesis_notes.md` → Redefine the basic principles for Speeders movements unlike traditional rocketry
