Yes — you can absolutely read your **test coverage report in your browser**, and it’s one of the best ways to visually explore what parts of your code are tested and what’s missing.

Here’s how to do that:

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step: View Pytest Coverage in Your Browser

### 1. Run Pytest with HTML Report
```bash
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html
open htmlcov/index.html 
```

This will generate a folder called `htmlcov/` in your project root.

---

### 2. Open the Coverage Report in Browser

Depending on your OS:

#### 🖥 macOS
```bash
open htmlcov/index.html
```

#### 🐧 Linux
```bash
xdg-open htmlcov/index.html
```

#### 🪟 Windows
```bash
start htmlcov/index.html
```

Or just navigate manually:
- Open your file browser
- Go to the `htmlcov/` folder
- Double-click `index.html`

---

### 3. Read the Coverage Report

Once open in the browser:
- ✅ Green lines = covered by tests
- ❌ Red lines = not covered
- 📄 Click on any file name to inspect line-by-line coverage
- 📊 Top bar = total percentage covered

---

## 🧠 Bonus: Keep It Clean
If you're doing this often, you can add to your `.gitignore`:

```
# Test coverage
htmlcov/
.coverage
```

---

Let me know if you want a quick script like `open_coverage.sh` or a `Makefile` command to automate it.
