Great question. If we want Prism‑Labs to test what’s on Terry’s site, these are the **minimum equations/objects we must implement** (so his claims are actually modelable and falsifiable).

# 1) Three‑body “resolution” (Lynchpin/Tetryen/Howard Comma)

* **Classical 3‑body Hamiltonian**
  $H=\sum_{k=1}^3 \frac{m_k}{2}\lVert \dot{\mathbf r}_k\rVert^2-\sum_{i<j}\frac{Gm_im_j}{\lVert \mathbf r_i-\mathbf r_j\rVert}+H(\kappa)$.  The paper adds a corrective term $H(\kappa)$. ([Lynchpin™][1])
* **Lynchpin geometric constraint** (their stabilizer):
  $\displaystyle \kappa(t)=\frac{\lVert \mathbf r_1-\mathbf r_2\rVert+\lVert \mathbf r_2-\mathbf r_3\rVert+\lVert \mathbf r_3-\mathbf r_1\rVert}{3}$, with the target node condition $ \dot{\kappa}(t)=0$.&#x20;
* **Tetryen iterative update** (their “harmonic node” step):
  $\displaystyle \mathbf r_k^{(n+1)}=\mathbf r_k^{(n)}+ i\,f(\kappa)\;-\;1\cdot g(\kappa)$ (where $f,g$ are user‑defined harmonic functions).&#x20;
* **Howard Comma (orbit error accumulator)**:
  $\displaystyle H(\kappa)=\int_{0}^{t}\gamma(\kappa,t')\,dt' \approx 0$ (drive this toward zero to claim “periodicity”).&#x20;

▶︎ **What to code:** a standard 3‑body integrator (symplectic), plus plug‑ins for $\kappa$, $\dot\kappa$ feedback control, the Tetryen step, and the Comma integral; then compare chaos/periodicity vs. baseline.

# 2) “Curvilinear hyperbolic space” & “1×1=2”

* **Metric form** they invoke:
  generic $ds^2=g_{ij}\,dx^i dx^j$ (with examples like $ds^2=dx^2+dy^2-\!dz^2$) to justify area warping; the claim “$1\times1=2$” is tied to **area‑doubling under their metric**.&#x20;

▶︎ **What to code:** a metric module that can (i) remap a square cell under a chosen $g_{ij}$, and (ii) compute area change; this lets us test their “curved multiplication” statement numerically.

# 3) “Cosmological Constant / Howard Comma” energy law

* **Replace $E=mc^2$ with a wave law**:
  $\boxed{E=C_H\,\omega}$ (Howard Comma $C_H$ acts like a constant of proportionality in a finite, wave‑bounded universe).&#x20;
* **Quantized standing‑wave levels** (finite box):
  $ \displaystyle E_n=\frac{n^2\,C_H^{\,2}}{8\,m\,L^2}$ (as written in their doc).&#x20;
* **Definition note:** the PDF sketches a relation for $C_H$ in terms of $h$ (typeset oddly: “$C_H = h/(2\varepsilon)$” or similar). We should keep it symbolic and fit $C_H$ from data/requirements until clarified.&#x20;

▶︎ **What to code:** an energy module that can switch between GR’s $E=mc^2$ and the Howard law $E=C_H\omega$; plus a standing‑wave solver for finite $L$ to reproduce their $E_n$.

# 4) “Geometry of the proton / Tetryen” (supporting EM/QM pieces)

* Use **Coulomb’s law** and standard EM to reproduce forces; their preprint discusses standing‑wave pictures and then writes Coulomb forms explicitly. ([Lynchpin™][2])

▶︎ **What to code:** standard Maxwell/Coulomb kernels (already have), with optional “standing‑wave” visualizations to match their figures.

## Minimal acceptance checklist for Prism‑Labs

1. **3‑body baseline**: reproduce chaotic divergence without add‑ons; with $\kappa$+Comma control, demonstrate any stabilizing effect and quantify it. (From their “Resolving the Three‑Body Problem”.) ([Lynchpin™][1])
2. **Curved‑multiplication test**: implement $g_{ij}$ and measure area changes; verify whether any reasonable metric yields the claimed **area‑doubling** that would justify “$1\times1=2$”.&#x20;
3. **Energy law swap**: run identical systems under $E=mc^2$ versus $E=C_H\omega$; show consequences for spectra $E_n$ in finite domains.&#x20;
4. **Parameter disclosure**: require explicit $f(\kappa), g(\kappa)$ forms and a numeric $C_H$; without these, results are only qualitative.

If you want, I’ll turn this into a tiny spec for the **four kernels** (ThreeBody+Lynchpin, MetricAreaWarp, HowardEnergy, StandingWaveBox) with I/O signatures so your drones can start running them.
