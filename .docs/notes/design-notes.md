- First we need a model of PrismMvp
- It's f(y)=m*x+b to Physics to Model to Application
- Application is API for Web, Mobile, Terminal, Game, and UI
- Goals:
  - Arch Legion trained on FotF Rules in Simulations
  - Simulation must be made to run on platform to train prisms
  - Idea: 1000 years of war in the blink of a command
  - Speeder Model -> Arch Legion Model
  - Fighter Model -> Speeder Model
  - Shuttle Model -> Arch Legion Model
  - Ship Model -> Fighter, Shuttle, and Arch Legion Model
- AC:
  - Model of Math, Science, and Engineering with GraphView in Nexus Labs
  - Model of Shuttle, Speeder, and Ship as projects in Nexus Labs
  - Model of Colony, Ship, and Legion as projects in Nexus Labs 
  - Save files and open then with prism-forge with prism-scribe and prism-tablet cases
