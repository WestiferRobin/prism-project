For 0D
- point on x, y, z, w, omega axis when t = i * tau then t - i * tau = 0

For 1D
- Length = distance = line = vector

For 2D
Area = l^2 = l * w = l * w * h = 1/2 * b * h
- Square
- Rectangle
- Circle
- Triangle

Volume = A * l = 4/3 pi * r^3

Mass = Volume * Density
Force = Mass * Acceleration

Energy <= Mass * c^2
Work = Force * Distance
